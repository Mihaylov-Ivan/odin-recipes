      A five-ingredient hamburger rice casserole topped with melty cheese. My
      grandma used to make this and it was always a hit. She uses American
      cheese, but I make it with mozzarella. Very easy and yummy!

      This best scrambled egg recipe took a bit of tweaking, but I've finally
      made the best scrambled eggs ever! My friends and family love it. I make
      it almost once a week before school.
